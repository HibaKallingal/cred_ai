### Program Overview
The program performs the following actions:
- Creates a `LinkedList` to store car names
- Adds elements to the list
- Adds an element at the beginning of the list
- Removes the last element
- Adds a new element at the end
- Prints the final contents of the list

### Key Concepts Used
- `LinkedList` from `java.util`
- Adding and removing elements
- Printing a collection

### Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How `LinkedList` works in Java
- Difference between adding elements at the beginning and end
- How to modify and display a list

### Output

[Mazda, Volvo, BMW, Skoda]
```
## StackExample

### Description
This program demonstrates how to use a `Stack` in Java and perform basic stack operations.

### Program Overview
The program performs the following actions:
- Creates a `Stack` to store color names
- Adds elements to the stack using `push()`
- Removes the top element using `pop()`
- Displays the top element using `peek()`
- Prints all elements present in the stack

### Key Concepts Used
- `Stack` from `java.util`
- Stack operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`
- Printing collections

### Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How a stack works using LIFO(Last In, First Out)
- How to add and remove elements in a stack
- How to access the top element of a stack

### Output
```
Green
[Red, Green]
```

## QueueExample

### Description
This program demonstrates how to use a `Queue` in Java and perform basic queue operations.

### Program Overview
The program performs the following actions:
- Creates a `Queue` to store integer values
- Adds elements to the queue
- Displays the front element using `peek()`
- Removes the front element using `poll()`
- Prints the remaining elements in the queue

### Key Concepts Used
- `Queue` interface from `java.util`
- `LinkedList` implementation of Queue
- Queue operations: `add`, `peek`, `poll`

### Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- How a queue works using FIFO(First In, First Out)
- How to add and remove elements in a queue
- How to access the front element of a queue

### Output

```
